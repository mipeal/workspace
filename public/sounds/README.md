# Sound Files

This directory contains placeholder files for sounds used in the application.

Replace these files with actual MP3 audio files:

- `success.mp3`: Brief sound for successful actions
- `error.mp3`: Brief sound for errors or failed actions
- `firstblood.mp3`: Exciting celebration sound for first blood animations

These sounds are used by the `useAppSounds` hook in the application.
